#### Version 5.0 - Currently in Development

### The new REMLAB development repository.

### [Working Demo of REMLAB](https://remlab.netlify.app)

REMLAB Web Mech Designer is a web application for creating BattleTech&reg; Mechs for use in the board game. REMLAB is the fifth version of this app that I have written. It is written entirely in JavaScript.

## Disclaimer

REMLAB is first and for most a personal programming project more so than a final working product. My ultimate goal is to produce something that is presentable in a portfolio or at a job interview. Development of this web app is on a sporadic basis and in my free time. If I do find time to continue development of this app, and expand on the features and lore I will do so... otherwise the code in its entirety can be found above.

## History

The first version of REMLAB dates back to 2005 when it was created as an early AJAX and PHP powered web app.

The second version I release in 2007 and it was built upon that same codebase, however with that version I expanded upon the game rules and features.

The Third version, released in 2010, was never finished, but it too was based upon the same codebase, but I had intended to redesign the interface.

For the fourth version, I chose to go back to the drawing board and I rewrote the entire codebase from scratch and in the process I moved from PHP to JavaScript for the main logic. This version was never entirely complete, but it was hosted on my website in 2017.
