REMLAB Web Mech Designer is a web application for creating BattleTech&reg; Mechs for use in the board game. REMLAB is the fifth version of this app that I have written. It is written entirely in JavaScript.

### Disclaimer

REMLAB is first and for most a personal programming project more so than a final working product. My ultimate goal is to produce something that is presentable in a portfolio or at a job interview. Development of this web app is on a sporadic basis and in my free time. If I do find time to continue development of this app, and expand on the features and lore I will do so... otherwise the code in its entirety can be found above.
